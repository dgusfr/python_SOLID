# Python SOLID Principles

This repository contains examples of the SOLID principles in Python. The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help developers create maintainable and scalable software. The principles are:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle is demonstrated with code examples in the `src` directory. The examples are organized by principle and include both good and bad implementations to illustrate the concepts clearly.
