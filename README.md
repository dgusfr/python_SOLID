# Python SOLID Principles

This repository contains examples of the SOLID principles in Python. The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help developers create maintainable and scalable software. The principles are:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle is demonstrated with code examples in the `src` directory. The examples are organized by principle and include both good and bad implementations to illustrate the concepts clearly.
